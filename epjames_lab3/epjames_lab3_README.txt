Hardware Connections:
    For the hardware connections, I include a jumper wire enabled for touch. I also include an external button that is meant to wake up the system through an external press.
    I also have the system software set to be able to wake up using the timer functionality. the code identifies which is the source of the wake up and outputs that. 

Hardware Pinout:
    -Button: Using a 1K ohm resistor the button is hooked up to pin 37 and ground.
    -Touch: A jumper wire is hooked up to Pin 14 which is enabled for touch
